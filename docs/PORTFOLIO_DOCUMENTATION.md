# DevSecOps CI/CD Pipeline - Portfolio Project Documentation

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Enterprise DevSecOps Pipeline for Homelab Infrastructure
**Duration**: November 2024 - January 2025
**Role**: DevOps Engineer / Security Engineer
**Repository**: [github.com/Carl-Frederic-Nickell/homelab](https://github.com/Carl-Frederic-Nickell/homelab)
**Status**: Phase 1 Production | Phase 2 Ready for Deployment

## Executive Summary

Designed and implemented a comprehensive DevSecOps CI/CD pipeline for a production homelab infrastructure running 20+ containerized services. The project demonstrates end-to-end security automation, supply chain security practices, and modern DevOps workflows using GitHub Actions, container security scanning, and policy-as-code enforcement.

## Technical Architecture

### Infrastructure Stack
- **Container Runtime**: Docker & Docker Compose
- **Orchestration**: Docker Compose (20+ services)
- **CI/CD Platform**: GitHub Actions
- **Source Control**: Git & GitHub
- **Target Environment**: Synology NAS DS1821+

### Security Tools Implemented
- **Trivy**: Container vulnerability scanning
- **Grype**: Additional vulnerability detection
- **Syft**: SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) generation
- **TruffleHog**: Secret detection and scanning
- **Open Policy Agent (OPA)**: Policy-as-code enforcement
- **yamllint**: YAML configuration validation
- **Hadolint**: Dockerfile linting

## Key Achievements

### Security Automation
- Implemented automated vulnerability scanning for all container images
- Configured multi-tool security scanning (Trivy + Grype) for comprehensive coverage
- Achieved zero hardcoded secrets in repository through environment variable management
- Established automated secret scanning with TruffleHog
- Generated SBOM for all services in both CycloneDX and SPDX formats

### Pipeline Development
- Built 3 automated GitHub Actions workflows:
  - Security scanning pipeline with artifact generation
  - SBOM generation and tracking
  - Policy validation with OPA and linting
- Implemented scheduled security scans (weekly automated audits)
- Created automated reporting and GitHub Step Summaries

### Policy Enforcement
- Developed 15+ OPA security policies for Docker best practices
- Implemented automated policy validation on every commit
- Created warning vs. critical violation tiers for gradual enforcement
- Established compliance checks for container security standards

### Repository Sanitization
- Sanitized 20+ Docker Compose configurations
- Migrated all sensitive data to environment variables
- Created comprehensive `.env.example` template
- Removed hardcoded credentials, API keys, and IP addresses

## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Security Scanning Pipeline

**Workflow**: `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`

**Features**:
- Multi-image scanning (20+ container images)
- Parallel scan execution for performance
- JSON and human-readable report generation
- Critical vulnerability detection and alerting
- Secret scanning across entire repository
- Docker Compose validation

**Results**:
- Scans complete in ~3 minutes
- Generates detailed vulnerability reports
- Identifies HIGH and CRITICAL CVEs
- Zero secrets detected after sanitization

### 2. SBOM Generation Pipeline

**Workflow**: `.github/workflows/sbom-generation.yml`

**Features**:
- Automated SBOM creation for all container images
- Dual-format support (CycloneDX + SPDX)
- License compliance checking
- Component tracking and versioning
- 365-day artifact retention for audit trails

**Output**:
- Individual SBOMs per service
- Combined SBOM index
- License compliance reports
- Automated badge generation

### 3. Policy Validation Pipeline

**Workflow**: `.github/workflows/policy-validation.yml`

**Features**:
- OPA policy enforcement
- YAML syntax validation
- Dockerfile best practices checking
- Automated PR comments with findings

**Policy Coverage**:
- Container security (privileged mode, root user)
- Resource limits validation
- Network configuration checks
- Health check requirements
- Logging configuration
- Volume mount security

## Services Managed

The pipeline manages security for 20+ services including:

**Monitoring & Observability**:
- Grafana, Prometheus, Loki, Promtail, cAdvisor

**Security & Logging**:
- Graylog, Filebeat, Pi-hole

**Media & Documents**:
- Plex, Jellyfin, Paperless-ngx

**Infrastructure**:
- Portainer, Ansible, Homebridge, Matomo

**Development**:
- Open WebUI, Dashy

## Challenges Solved

### Challenge 1: Secret Management
**Problem**: 20+ services with hardcoded credentials and sensitive data
**Solution**:
- Created Python sanitization script for automated credential removal
- Implemented environment variable strategy with `.env.example`
- Configured GitHub Secrets for CI/CD workflows
- Achieved 100% secret-free repository

### Challenge 2: Large-Scale Container Scanning
**Problem**: Scanning 20+ images causes long pipeline execution times
**Solution**:
- Implemented parallel scanning where possible
- Added smart caching mechanisms
- Scheduled heavy scans during off-peak hours
- Optimized scan configurations

### Challenge 3: Policy Compliance vs. Legacy Services
**Problem**: Existing services didn't meet new security standards
**Solution**:
- Implemented tiered policy enforcement (warnings vs. denials)
- Created gradual migration path
- Documented remediation steps
- Prioritized critical issues

### Challenge 4: CI/CD Environment Validation
**Problem**: Docker Compose validation fails without environment variables
**Solution**:
- Modified validation to check syntax only in CI
- Implemented smart error handling
- Added informative messages about missing env vars
- Prevented false negatives

## Metrics & Results

### Security Improvements
- **Vulnerability Detection**: 287 vulnerabilities identified across all services
- **Critical CVEs**: Tracked and documented for remediation
- **Secret Exposure**: Reduced from several hardcoded secrets to zero
- **Policy Compliance**: 95%+ compliance rate achieved

### Automation Metrics
- **Pipeline Execution**: Average 3-5 minutes per run
- **Scan Coverage**: 100% of container images
- **SBOM Generation**: Automated for all 20+ services
- **Scheduled Scans**: Weekly automated security audits

### Code Quality
- **YAML Linting**: 100% pass rate
- **Policy Validation**: All services validated
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive inline and external docs

## Lessons Learned

1. **Security First**: Integrating security early (shift-left) catches issues before they reach production
2. **Automation Pays Off**: Initial setup time investment yields continuous benefits
3. **Documentation Matters**: Clear documentation enables team adoption and maintenance
4. **Iterative Approach**: Start with critical policies, expand gradually
5. **Tool Selection**: Multiple tools provide better coverage than single solutions
